Hi Everyone!

During my time as a Web Developer Intern at Codsoft, I had the opportunity to work on my software development skills. I spent my time working on various projects which allowed me to test my skills and learn along the way.

My Landing Page Project -  This user-friendly project design involved creating columns, different sections, arranging items, and adding headers and footers. It also required using alignments, padding, colour palettes, boxes, and other elements.
