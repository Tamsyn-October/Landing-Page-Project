Hi Everyone!

During my time as a Web Developer Intern at Codsoft, I had the opportunity to work on my software development skills. I spent my time working on various projects which allowed me to test my skills and learn along the way.

My Portfolio Project includes a header section, about section, project, skills, resume, contact, and footer section. 
This project allowed me to go above and beyond what I knew at the time as a self-taught developer.
